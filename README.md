# OnlineShop

During my first semester at Universite de Montreal, I had my first programming class which was an web development class. 
I developed an online shop which enabled users to explore product offerings and place selected items into their shopping cart for purchase.
I used HTML, CSS and Javscript (Jquery) to develop this platform. The plaform was more focused on front-end and user interface design.
I am proud of this project since it was my first ever time programming and I learned & gained a lot of interest in the web development industry since then!
